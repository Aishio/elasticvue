## About

**Elasticvue** is a frontend for elasticsearch allowing you to search and filter your clusters data right in your browser.

It works with every elasticsearch version supported by the [official elasticsearch javascript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticsearch):

* 6.X
* 5.X
* 2.X

### Features

* Cluster overview
* Indices overview, index detailed view
* Browse documents by searching
* Manually running every query supported by the official elasticsearch client
* Utilities, e.g. deleting all indices

## Usage

### Running

Use one of the following ways to run elasticvue:

**Online version**

* Visit [http://elasticvue.cars10k.de](http://elasticvue.cars10k.de) or [hï¿¼ttps://elasticvue.cars10k.de](https://elasticvue.cars10k.de) (if your cluster is only accessible through SSL)

**Docker**

Use the existing image:

* `docker run -p 8090:8090 -d cars10/elasticvue` [Image at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cars10/elasticvue) (~50mb compressed)

Or build the image locally:

* Checkout the repo `git clone https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue.git`
* Open the folder `cd elasticvue`
* Build `docker build -t elasticvue .`
* Run `docker run -p 8090:8090 elasticvue`

**Chrome extension**

Install the extension from the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticvue/hkedbapjpblbodpgbajblpnlpenaebaa).

**Run locally**

* Checkout the repo `git clone https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue.git`
* Open the folder `cd elasticvue`
* Install dependencies `yarn install`
* Run a production server via `yarn prod` or dev server `yarn dev`


### Elasticsearch configuration
You have to set some settings to allow connection to your elasticsearch cluster, even if you run the app locally.

Find your elasticsearch configuration (for example `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`) and add the following lines:

```yaml
# see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html
# Enable 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
http.cors.enabled: true
# Then set the allowed origins based on how you run elasticvue:

# for docker / running locally
http.cors.allow-origin: /https?:\/\/localhost(:[0-9]+)?/
# online version
http.cors.allow-origin: /https?:\/\/elasticvue.cars10k.de/
# chrome extension
http.cors.allow-origin: /chrome-extension:\/\/[a-z]+/

# or to enable all sources:
http.cors.allow-origin: /(https?:\/\/localhost(:[0-9]+)?)|(chrome-extension:\/\/[a-z]+)|(https?:\/\/elasticvue.cars10k.de)/
```

Now simply restart elasticsearch and you should be able to connect.
